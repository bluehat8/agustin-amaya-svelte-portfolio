        <h2>Hello! ðŸ‘‹</h2>
        <p>I'm Jhey (pronounced "J"). I'm a web developer that thrives on bringing ideas to life with code!</p>
        <p>I advocate for creative coding giving you the confidence to build anything imaginable. I enjoy speaking about this and showing people how to level up their skills.</p>
        <p>I'm known for my whimsical creations and ability to solve complex problems. This led to me getting branded as somewhat of a polyglot coder. It's incredible to me that you can open a computer and learn about anything at your fingertips!</p>
