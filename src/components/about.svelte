        <p>I'm Agustin Amaya, a Systems Engineer with experience building end-to-end web solutions. I specialize in designing and deploying applications using technologies like .NET, NestJS, and React. My focus on agile methodologies such as Scrum has enabled me to lead the delivery of successful projects, from job search platforms to dental management systems.</p>

            My passion for technology led me to the blockchain world. I've taken on the role of smart contract developer in various hackathons, even winning first place for best decentralized application on Ethereum with my project Cuchulink at ETH Volcano 2024. Recently, I led the launch of NeoArk Capital Fund, where I designed and implemented a complete Web3 investment platform. I'm motivated by transforming complex ideas into functional products that generate real value.
